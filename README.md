## Background

C2 is used by TTS to track, approve, and resolve certain categories of purchases, such as trainings or those under the micro-purchase threshold of $3,500. C2 is relied-upon infrastructure within TTS and is currently in use, but it does not currently have the support of a development team behind it to perform regular maintenance or add new features.

To help the Government understand what approach to take and how to invest in it, a thorough code review of the codebase is required. The Government requires to obtain a report that summarizes current-state issues as well as actionable next steps, such as (but not limited to) recommended refactors. The report and any related findings will be made public.

### What we're hoping to end up with

Additional information is provided in [Section 9.0](https://github.com/18F/tts-buy-code-review/blob/master/solicitation_documents/RFQ.md#90-performance-work-statement) of the RFQ, but in short:

> The vendor must:
> 
> - Review the [entire codebase](https://github.com/18F/C2) (approximately 29,869 lines of code) with a focus on functionality and maintainability.
> - Provide the Government with a final report, summarizing the functionality and maintainability of the system. In addition to any sections necessary to address those topics, the report should include: (1) all the issues found; and, (2) an estimated number of developer hours to resolve the high-priority issues.
