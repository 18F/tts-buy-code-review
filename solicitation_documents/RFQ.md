A late quotation will not be considered for award.

## 2.0 Administration
Unless expressly authorized by the RFQ, any Quoter planning to take exception to a term or condition of the RFQ should consult with the Contracting Officer (CO) in writing before submitting a quotation.

The Quoters are advised to closely read the quote instructions outlined within section 8.0 Quotation Instructions before preparing a technical quotation.

## 3.0 Background
C2 is used by TTS to track, approve, and resolve certain categories of purchases, such as trainings or those under the micro-purchase threshold of $3,500. C2 is relied-upon infrastructure within TTS and is currently in use, but it does not currently have the support of a development team behind it to perform regular maintenance or add new features.

To help the Government understand what approach to take and how to invest in it, a thorough code review of the codebase is required. The Government requires to obtain a report that summarizes current-state issues as well as actionable next steps, such as (but not limited to) recommended refactors. The report and any related findings will be made public.

## 4.0 Period of Performance
The Period of Performance (“POP”) is 4 weeks. The POP is expected to begin within 10 calendar days after award - specifically, from the day a kickoff is held with the contractor.

## 5.0 Type of Contract
Based on the nature of this requirement, the government intends to award a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) task order.

## 6.0 Pricing Structure
The Quoter is required to complete the attached [RFQ Pricing Response Form](https://goo.gl/forms/8GiHlaztZf64SFzd2).

## 7.0 Special Instructions
**a. Communications Before Award.** The Quoter shall direct all communications to the Contracting Officer.

**b. Potential Organizational Conflicts of Interest Statement.** No task order award shall be made until any potential conflict of interest has been neutralized or mitigated to the satisfaction of the CO in accordance with Subpart FAR 9.5 [Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest](https://www.acquisition.gov/sites/default/files/current/far/html/Subpart%209_5.html#wp1078823). Acknowledgement of this statement is to be made within the [RFQ Technical Response Form](https://goo.gl/forms/LOk2nmwsfNToGvuJ3).

A quotation that fails to include both of the forms identified above will not be considered for award. 

## 9.0 Performance Work Statement
To fulfill the objectives for performance of this task order, the contractor must meet the user needs described in the following subsections.

### 9.1 Required work
The vendor must:

- Review the [entire codebase](https://github.com/18F/C2) (approximately 29,869 lines of code) with a focus on functionality and maintainability.
- Provide the Government with a final report, summarizing the functionality and maintainability of the system. In addition to any sections necessary to address those topics, the report should include: (1) all the issues found; and, (2) an estimated number of developer hours to resolve the high-priority issues.

The vendor must provide any raw notes, inline comments, or any other similar documentation created along the way towards a final report. This documentation will not be made public in raw form.

The final report should rank any issues found as high-, medium-, and low-priority. Any high-priority issues should include an estimated number of developer hours required to address them along with the assumptions upon which that estimate is based. Each issue reported should include links to [issues filed](https://github.com/18F/C2/issues) by the vendor (or others) in the [project’s GitHub repository](https://github.com/18F/C2). Issues include, but are not limited to:
- Any deviations from Ruby best practices as determined by the vendor and the Government
- Poorly styled code according to [this style guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide).
- Any unused code that can be removed.
- Poor code readability.
- Any portions that are overly nested.
- Any portions with high cyclomatic complexity.
- Any repetitive code.
- Undocumented sections of code.

### 9.2 Required Knowledge
The codebase has [the following dependencies](https://github.com/18F/C2/blob/master/doc/setup.md):
- Ruby 2.3.3
- Rails 4.2
- PostgreSQL 9.x
- Elasticsearch 1.5+

### 9.3 Additional requirements
- Status meetings must be held on a regular schedule that is mutually agreed upon by the Contractor and the Government, but no more frequently than weekly.
- Contractor agrees to allow the Government to post any deliverables, including the final report, to a publicly-available code repository, with a Public Domain license.
- Contractor must use plain language in the final report whenever possible. In the event that TTS does not provide the Contractor with content-specific guidance or grammatical rules, Contractor should adhere to GSA TTS [18F’s content guide](https://content-guide.18f.gov/).
- The Government does not anticipate any software code will be delivered under this task order. However, should the vendor deliver any code as part of the final report, it shall comply with the [18F open source policy](http://github.com/18F/open-source-policy/) in effect as of the date of award.
- All documentation delivered under this order shall comply with the [18F Accessibility Guidelines](https://pages.18f.gov/accessibility/) in effect as of the date of award.

## 10.0 Basis of Award and Evaluation Criteria
This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Subpart 8.4, Federal Supply Schedules. This is not a FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, procurement. All submissions in response to this RFQ are considered quotations and not proposals or offers, even if labeled as such. The offerors agree to and are bound by all instructions, procedures and rules of this RFQ. The Government is not obligated to determine a competitive range, conduct discussions, solicit final revised quotations, or use other techniques associated with FAR part 15. The contracting techniques associated with FAR Part 15.3 do not apply.

The final award for this requirement will be based on best-value principles, utilizing the trade-off process. Accordingly, award will be made to the responsible and technically acceptable offeror whose quotation provides the greatest overall value to the Government, price and other factors considered.

The Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical capabilities than with making awards at the lowest overall price to the Government. However, the Government will not make awards at a significantly higher overall price to achieve slightly superior technical value. Offerors are advised that the technical evaluation factors combined are significantly more important than price.

**Evaluation Process.** The Government intends to utilize a phased approach for this procurement as described below. To be considered for award, offerors must successfully pass through each phase.
- Phase 1: Technical Evaluation and Oral Interview - The Government will evaluate the offeror’s code review process and the technical quotation received via the Google Form. The oral interview will be focused on the offeror’s technical approach, staffing plan, and similar experience, as well as their overall understanding of the requirements to perform a code review and provide a substantive final report, among other factors outlined in the solicitation. The oral interview is an opportunity for the Government to ask the vendor questions -- the Government does not want vendor presentations during this interview.
- Phase 2: Pricing Schedule - Offeror’s Price as provided in the price quotation received via the Google Form will be reviewed separately from the technical evaluation.  

**Technical Evaluation Factors.** The Government will evaluate responses received during Phase 1 for an offeror’s performance or capability acceptability based on the following non-price technical factors, which are of equal importance to each other:

*1. Recent and Similar Experience:* The offeror shall provide at least one but no more than three examples of a final product of previous code review projects. While a written report is envisioned as a final product for this solicitation, other formats are acceptable. The final product must have been delivered by either a) the offeror itself or b) a subcontractor that is proposed in response to this RFQ. In the project summary, be sure to identify how the offeror’s team was involved in the review.

At a minimum, provide:
- A link to previous work product (whether final report or links to pull requests). If unavailable, a link to an anonymized version of the same. Anonymized version will be evaluated equally with non-anonymized ones
- If you cannot provide either of the above, please provide a link to a sample report outline or narrative of what you have done in terms of code review and presenting your findings.

In order to be considered recent and similar, the experience must involve performing code review on usable, responsive, consumer facing applications completed within the past three (3) years.

If it is public, the summary shall include links to the source code repository that includes the codebase that was reviewed for the project. The projects should be recent and similar to the size and technical scope of this requirement.

*2. Staffing Plan:* The offeror shall submit a Staffing Plan which outlines the number of personnel by skill level/labor category needed to satisfy the objectives and requirements of the PWS under the offeror’s Technical approach. All proposed skill levels/labor categories shall be consistent with the contractor's Schedule price list.

At a minimum, provide:
- A description of your staffing methodology based on your understanding of the requirements.
- A  breakdown of labor categories, including the title, number of personnel, and hours.

*3. Technical Understanding and Approach:* The offeror shall succinctly describe their level of knowledge, technical expertise, approach to code review, and an overall understanding of the requirement as set forth in the PWS.

**Price Evaluation Factors.** Each offeror’s price quotation will be evaluated separately from the technical quotation and verbal interview. Proposed prices shall be evaluated for reasonableness and consistency with industry standards. Note that as submissions become more technically equal in their merit, the evaluated price becomes more important. Therefore, it is critical that the Offeror submit their best quotation initially.

## 11.0 Invoicing
The contractor must submit one invoice at the end of the period of performance. This is considered their final invoice. The contractor must submitted it within 60 calendar days from contract completion and no further charges are to be billed. With the submission of a final invoice, a completed and signed Release of Claims (GSA Form 1142) shall be provided to the CO.

### 11.1 Content of Invoice
In addition to the requirements for a proper invoice specified in FAR 52.212-4 (g) and the Prompt Payment clause, FAR 52.212-4(i)(2), the following information or documentation must be submitted with each invoice, all of which will be provided at time of award:

- Contract/Order Number
- Period of Performance covered by the invoice
- CLIN number and title
- The Accounting Number Associated with the task order

### 11.2 Invoice Submission
The Contractor is required to submit invoices to GSA Vendor Customer Self Service (VCSS) and the Contracting Officer Representative (COR). GSA TTS does not manage or run this system. All invoicing questions should be directed to customer support at 866-450-6588 or the VCSS customer service site https://vcss.ocfo.gsa.gov/.

## 12.0 Daily Activities and Kickoff
### 12.1 Post Award Orientation Conference
The Government's team, CO/COR, and the TTS Product Owner will hold a Kickoff Meeting/Post-Award Conference with the contractor. This Kickoff will include the contractor’s team and other relevant Government staff to review and clarify the project’s objectives, expectations from the Government, and address any questions the contractor may have. 

The Kickoff Meeting/Post-Award Conference will take place within 10 calendar days from award.

### 12.2 Early Termination
Should the contractor be terminated prior to the end of the period of performance, the contractor shall transfer all project materials to the CO/COR and the TTS Product Owner within two weeks of the CO/COR and the TTS Product Owner’s request.

### 12.3 Travel
No travel is anticipated or will be required as part of this task order.

### 12.4 Government Furnished Items
The [codebase](https://github.com/18F/C2) has been posted and made publicly available on GitHub. Whatever documentation related to C2 that is requested by the vendor at the vendor kickoff and throughout the period of performance will be provided, should it exist. No other hardware or software will be provided by the Government nor will the Government develop any additional documentation.

## 13.0 Transparency Policy
The Quoter is advised that TTS will publish on a publicly available website documents associated with this requirement, including any Requests for Quotations (including amendments), Question and Answer exchanges with the Quoter (source-identifying information removed), and other relevant information that is not confidential/proprietary in nature and other relevant information that is not marked as confidential or proprietary or does not constitute source selection information that would otherwise implicate procurement integrity concerns.

Upon award, TTS will publish the total price of the selected quotation and certain non-source-identifying data (for example, the final awarded price). During the performance of this contract, TTS may similarly publish data related to project management, and top-line spending data.

## 14.0 Contract Provisions, Clauses, and Policies Incorporated
### 14.1 508 Compliance
The contractor shall support the Government in its compliance with Section 508 throughout the development and implementation of the work to be performed.

Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires that when Federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic information technology, Federal employees with disabilities have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use by Federal employees who do not have disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. Section 508 also requires that individuals with disabilities, who are members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal agency, have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to the public who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency.
